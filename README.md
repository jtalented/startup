# Mad Lib
This application is a mad lib that allows users to generate prompts and fill in the associated words to create fun stories and responses.

## Elevator Pitch
One of the timeless classic games that has been around since the 1950s, Mad libs are a great way to pass the time whether by yourself or with your family or friends. Mad libs have generally required a pen and prompt packet but now with only your phone or electronic device, you can access a plethora of generated prompts with easy access. Even if you've run out of ideas, you can view recent submissions from other users and keep your creative mind working.

## Design

The application will have a simple login page where a database is used to validate and add new users

The application itself will immediately generate an input prompt for the user with the associated word types. From this page, the user can submit their words (which are validated to not be empty before submission) as well as view recent submissions (last 10) by all users. When a user submits their prompt, the resulting information is added to the text, and the story is displayed to the user. The user can then download the text as .txt file. At any point, the user may request a new prompt or logout.
